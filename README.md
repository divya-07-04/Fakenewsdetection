📰 Fake News Detection
📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning-based system to detect and classify news articles as either fake or real.
With the rapid spread of misinformation worldwide, automatically identifying fake news is crucial for promoting trusted information sources.
The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple machine learning models to train a classifier that flags fake news with high accuracy.

✨ Features
✅ Preprocesses raw news text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
✅ Uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
✅ Implements multiple ML algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
✅ Evaluates models using: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
✅ Visualizes dataset distribution and model performance

Dataset
The dataset contains labeled news articles categorized as “fake” or “real.”
Each record includes:
📰 News text content
🏷️ Label (fake / real)

📊 Results
The implemented models demonstrate a strong ability to distinguish between fake and real news.
Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, showing high reliability for real-world applications in misinformation detection.

🔮 Future Work
🔹 Integrate deep learning NLP models like BERT for improved context understanding
🔹 Develop a real-time web app or API for user interaction
🔹 Expand dataset with more diverse sources for better generalization
