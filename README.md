# Fakenewsdetection
Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning-based model to detect and classify news articles as either fake or real. With the rapid spread of misinformation worldwide, automatically identifying fake news is crucial for promoting trusted information sources.

The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning algorithms on a dataset of labeled news articles to train a classifier that can flag fake news with high accuracy.

Features
Preprocesses news text data including cleaning and tokenization

Uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction

Implements multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Provides visualization of dataset distribution and model evaluation

Dataset
The dataset used contains labeled news articles categorized as “fake” or “real.” It consists of textual content along with labels used for supervised machine learning.

Requirements
Hardware
Minimum 4GB RAM

Processor: Intel i3 or equivalent

Disk Space: At least 500MB free for dataset and processing

Software
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, re

Installation
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
How to Use
Clone the repository

Open the fakenewsdetection.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook

Run the notebook cells in order to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results

Adjust parameters and classifiers as needed to optimize performance

Results
The models implemented provide a strong ability to discriminate between fake and real news with high accuracy, showing potential for real-world applications in misinformation detection.

Future Work
Integrate deep learning NLP models like BERT for improved context understanding

Develop a real-time web app or API for users to input news text for fake detection

Expand dataset with more diverse news sources for better generalization
